* This is a simple REST CRUD test program
* written using node.js 
*
* There is no persistence, so restarting will reset to the original data.
* This was intentional, since the purpose was to provide a test server 
* that I could use the CRUD (create/read/update/delete) methods on.


This was primary tested with curl and http-console

At this point it only outputs JSON.
I am planning on adding XML at some future point.
